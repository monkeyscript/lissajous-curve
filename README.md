# Lissajous Curve

Lissajous curve is the graph of a system of following parametric equations which describe complex harmonic motion.

`x = Asin(at + Ï•), y = Bsin(bt)`

It was studied by Nathaniel Bowditch, an American mathematician in 1815 and later in detail by Jules Antoine Lissajous, a French physicist in 1857.

All the parameters can be tuned and the simulator plots 100 points per second with varying `t` value.
